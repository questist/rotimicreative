									<div class="goals">
									  I am a Web Developer who understands back-end and front-end development. I have experience with both Vue.js and React. My focus is currently on Front-End development through becoming more proficient in Javascript. I would like to explore Back-End technologies through Node.js and Python to become a Full-Stack Developer. The current state of a thriving community of developers and frameworks is interesting because there is always something fresh and new to apply to solve common problems. I have an eye for design and am a contributor to a startup still in the development phase.
									</div>

									<div class="experience uk-inline">
										<div class="circle uk-position-top-center uk-inline"><span class="uk-position-center uk-text-center">GOALS<br>EXP.</span></div>
										I believe I have an aptitude for coding and do enjoy the process. Originally, I learned OOP programming using C++. It has helped me be able to quickly adopt new things. For example, I quickly learned CodeIgniter a PHP MVC and developed a dashboard for a customers portfolio site and have worked with other frameworks applying them to solve specific problems. I have been the lead on several small projects and I am an effective self-starter who does not shy away from a problem. I have spent a good amount of time evaluating different tools because I find the activity of learning about the different software tools available in the web landscape interesting.

									  I have been coding since 1999 with in depth C++ experience. I also started with HTML before CSS was around back in 2001. Since then I have used a multitude of coding languages like Python and PHP. In Python I have done some statistical analysis with data and with PHP I have built websites using CodeIgniter MVC and also built a custom theme for one of my clients using Wordpress. I have used jQuery for a few live projects and have continued learning Vue.js and React. Currently, my blog will(is) implemented in Vue.js and I am working with a startup to build a React Native app. I feel there will still be some congruency between the web and DevOps so I will continue to brush up on my C++ in the near future as well as continue my experience and knowledge in Full Stack Development. I currently work for a marketing company doing HTML/CSS and Wordpress work. Because of the nature of their workflow I don't get to code as much as I expected so I am looking for a new position that will allow me to fulfill the role of Front End Developer to a greater capacity.

								<p>I worked with a 5 other writers to create a blog based on reviewing book to film adaptations. The blog was a personal not for profit site. It started with a more serious tone through the voices of it's authors. However, I found that adding some humor helped make the reviews easier to write and the content more cohesive especially on social media. I started including tongue in cheek references and memes. This was a way to pivot the sites content, currently I may release a similar project on that domain after some further research. </p>
